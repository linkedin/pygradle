PyGradle is an enterprise Python build system.

PyGradle leverages [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) to empower Python's existing
ecosystem to solve problems like dependency management, polyglot projects, and
[lots more](https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2016/08/introducing--py-gradle--an-open-source-python-plugin-for-gradle).
LinkedIn has been using PyGradle for several years to successfully manage
thousands of Python dependencies.

PyGradle produces artifacts, e.g., source distributions, that are forward and
backward compatible with artifacts produced by vanilla
[setuptools](https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), so there is nothing
stopping you from using PyGradle with one, two, or all of your Python projects
right away!

As a general philosophy, we strive to enhance Python rather than replace it,
thereby keeping open source Python development idiomatic and intuitive.

# Usage

PyGradle does not include batteries: there are a few things that you're going
to have to do to use PyGradle for things beyond our provided [examples](examples).

In particular, you're going to have to:

- Decide how you want to host your artifacts.
- Decide how you want to distribute a custom setuptools distribution class.
- Author your build.gradle file.

These decisions and tasks shouldn't take too long for you finish, but they are
required. A deeper dive into what it takes to get started, how you can use our
demonstrative Artifactory instance, and a few project examples is available in
our detailed [getting started](docs/getting-started.md) guide.

Although not required, if you've never used Gradle before, you might
find reading Gradle's [user guide](https://docs.gradle.org/3.3/userguide/userguide.html)
helpful.

## Plugins

PyGradle comes with several plugins available, for specific details on each
plugin check the documentation specific to that plugin.
