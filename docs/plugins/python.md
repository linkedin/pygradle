# com.linkedin.python

## About

The `com.linkedin.python` plugin adds an extension called `python` to the project. It also configures a python project to setup a virtual env and run the tests. There are no artifacts produced by this plugin alone, you should check out other plugins to generate artifacts for the project.
 
 ```
 python {
    docsDir = project.file('docs').path // The location of this project's Sphinx documentation directory
    testDir = project.file('test').path // The location of this project's tests directory.
    srcDir = project.file('src').path // The location of this project's source directory.
    setupCfg = project.file('src').path // The location of this project's setup.cfg file.
    pinnedFile = project.file('pinned.txt') // A file generated by the build for pip install to consume in no pygradle builds
    pythonEnvironment = [:] // Environment variables that will be passed to python commands. This will overwrite any existing env variables.
    pipConfig = [:] // A Map of Maps to build a pip configuration file in your venv
    
    details {
        virtualEnvPrompt = "(${project.name})"
        activateLink = project.file("activate") // File you can source to activate the virtual env
        // pythonVersion = '2.6' // Sets the version of python to use, will search your PATH to get the location
        // systemPythonInterpreter = file("/path/to/python2.7") // used to force an interpreter to be used to build the venv
    }
}
 ```

## Usage

```
plugins {
    id 'com.linkedin.python', version <latest version>
}
```

## pipConfig Examples
Sometimes you need to configure pip inside of the venv itself.  The most common use cases are when you don't use 
pypi.python.com, but you use your own internal pypi server, or you need to set a proxy.  Typically, you can configure 
this with an operating system
level pip.* file as documented on the [pip web site](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/#config-file).  But
occasionally you need to configure this on a per-project basis.  This is where this setting comes in.  Take this example

```
python{
     pipConfig = ['global':['index-url': 'https://<login>:<password>@your.repo.com/custom/url', 'timeout': '60']]
}
```

This is a map of maps.  The above will result in a pip.conf (or pip.ini on windows) of

```
[global]
index-url = https://<login>:<password>@your.repo.com/custom/url
timeout = 60
```

All of the standard pip configurations will work, this is simply a way of generating the file in the venv

## Conditional Task Disabling
PyGradle will automatically disable tasks if certain conditions are present.

* Product install will abort if no `projectRoot/setup.py` file is present
* pytest will skip if the configured `python.testDir` doesn't exist
* coverage will skip if the configured `python.testDir` doesn't exist
* flake8 will skip if both `python.testDir` and `python.srcDir` doesn't exist
* both Sphinx Documentation tasks will skip if the configured `python.docsDir` doesn't exist

## Default and allowed Python version
This plugin enforces a set of default and allowed Python versions.  For
example, you can specify `pythonVersion = '3'` and you will get whatever the
default Python 3 version is.  Similarly `pythonVersion = '2'` gets you
whatever the default Python 2 version is.

This plugin also enforces a set of allowed Python versions.  If you choose a
Python version that is not allowed, you will see an error messages such as:

```
> Python 3.2 not allowed; choose from [2.6, 2.7, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6]
```

If you see this error message, you must adjust your `pythonVersion` setting to
one of the allowed values.

Consumers of this extension can change the default Python 2, Python 3, and
allowed versions by making a call on the `PythonDetails` object, either the
one returned by `PythonExtension.getDetails()` or on any `PythonDetails`
instance you create, e.g. in Groovy:

```groovy
pythonDetails.setPythonDefaultVersions('2.7', '3.6', ['2.7', '3.5', '3.6'])
```
