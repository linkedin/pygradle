       that class and tests.  We'd like to be able to completely test
       PythonDetails.setPythonVersion() too, but that's currently impossible,
       since that method searches for a Python interpreter on the file system
       matching the selected version.  We can't guarantee that such a Python
       version will exist so we can't test it without perhaps some mocking of
       operatingSystem.findInPath() , which I haven't been able to come up
       with yet.

       It does seem like this one can be tested though.
